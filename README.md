*This is a project written by Michael Weber for General Assembly's Full Stack Web Development course, cohort WDI 10, in Chicago*

• This project is intended to test my basic knowledge of vanilla Javascript, using objects, functions, and data structures to build a space battle game

• The game interface is the browser console, prompts, alerts, and confirmation menus. The user can play this game either by cloning it onto their machine and running it locally or playing it on my website at http://mnweber.me/space-battle.html (not up yet)

• It was written in vanilla Javascript, HTML5, and CSS3 using Sublime Text 3.
